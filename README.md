# Aura: Your Confidential AI Wellness Companion - Prototype

**Team Name:** Creators 2.0  
**Team Leader:** Riya Vhora
**Team Member:** Rahi Patel
**Problem Statement:** Generative AI for Youth Mental Wellness

## Project Overview

**Aura** is a prototype for an AI-powered, empathetic chat application designed to be a safe and confidential "first step" for youth mental wellness in India. It addresses the significant challenge that many young people face when struggling with mental health issues but hesitate to seek help due to social stigma, fear of judgment, and lack of access to youth-friendly resources.

## The Problem We're Solving

A significant number of young people in India struggle with mental health challenges but hesitate to seek help due to:
- Social stigma surrounding mental health
- Fear of judgment from family and peers
- Lack of access to youth-friendly resources
- Not knowing where to start or how to take the first step

## Our Solution

Aura serves as a compassionate "first step" - not a replacement for therapy, but a supportive guide that empowers users to understand their feelings and navigate the path to seeking help. This prototype demonstrates the core concept and user experience that would be enhanced with advanced AI capabilities in the full implementation.

## Current Prototype Features

This web-based prototype demonstrates the key user experience and functionality:

### 1. **Empathetic Chat Interface**
- Supportive AI companion available 24/7
- Non-judgmental conversation space
- Context-aware responses to common mental health concerns
- *Note: Full implementation would use Google Gemini API for advanced conversational AI*

### 2. **Digital Journaling System**
- Private space for reflection and self-expression
- Persistent local storage for privacy
- Easy-to-use interface for regular journaling
- *Note: Full version would include AI-generated guided journaling prompts*

### 3. **Resource Bridge to Local Care**
- Curated directory of verified Indian mental health resources
- Youth-focused helplines and organizations
- Easy access to professional support when ready
- Includes NIMHANS, Kiran Helpline, iCALL, and other trusted services

## What Makes Aura Different

### **Empathetic Conversation**
Unlike scripted chatbots, Aura (in full implementation) uses advanced Generative AI to create truly empathetic, human-like conversations that make users feel genuinely heard.

### **Active Stigma Reduction**
Designed specifically to normalize mental health conversations and reduce the fear of judgment that prevents young people from seeking help.

### **Guided Path to Local Care**
Unlike global platforms, Aura focuses on connecting users with verified local professionals and resources in India, providing a clear pathway from digital support to professional care.
